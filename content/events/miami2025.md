## hackathon rules

 there will be a 24 hour hackathon sprint starting after the workshops (please sleep tho) for plebs to build and showcase innovative ideas for the bitcoin ecosystem. if you don't have any ideas yet, the workshops will most definitely give you some inspiration. üí°

there will be prizes in different categories! (subject to change till the event starts).

| category | cash prize |
| --------- | ----- |
| 1st place | $3000 |
| 2nd place | $2000 |
| 3rd place | $1000 |


## basic rules
**must be new**

no cheating allowed -- while it's OK if your submission is part of a larger
project or ecosystem, the point is to try out new things and explore. there's no [firm rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it) here -- we'll know
cheating when we see it, and disqualify at our discretion. when in doubt, ask an organizer if your project is in the spirit of the event.

**teams**

teams can have 3-4 members. form them with your friends ahead of time or with people that you meet during workshops. you can also join the tg channel after you purchase a tix.

to make the event more inclusive, you can have one 'remote only'
teammate, just let us know in advance who they are. in the spirit of getting
real remote participants, we encourage remotes to be e.g. 2 hours+ away from
miami (if you see them during the event in person it's a disqualifier).

## how to win

BUIDL A THING IN THE METAPROTOCOL UNIVERSE AND MAKE NEW FRIENDS ALONG THE WAY!

we're going to specifically evaluate on the following categories:

1) did you learn something new that others can learn from?
2) how related is it to the theme of metaprotocols?
3) is it cool?

therefore hackathon submissions should include:
1. overview of the project
1. a demo including some code
1. summary of new things you've learned during the hackathon
